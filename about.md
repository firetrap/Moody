Moody will be our main access to the Moodle e-learning platform, but it was also thought to be our best friend, the one who will help us with every school matter. The desired idea is Moody to be known as a friend and not a resource. Therefore, it will have access to the Moodle content, show us the information in a user friendly environment and notify about new developments in our important and favorite subjects.
